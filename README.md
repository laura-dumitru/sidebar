# Sidebar

## An interactive project built with JavaScript and GSAP animation.

This is a replica of a mobile ad built while working at Mobkoi. Sidebar can be used by brands who want to showcase their products. It uses GSAP animation on the chevron-left and chevron-right icons to prompt the user to open the sidebar and explore its contents.

## The problem it solves

The product was created to address a limitation in the company software, which only allowed users to tap to open the sidebar, rather than drag. With high demand from clients, this product filled a crucial gap in functionality.

## User instructions

Follow the arrow direction and drag the sidebar to the right to open and to the left to close it.

## Developer instructions

```sh
git clone https://github.com/laura-dumitru/sidebar.git
```

## Current issues

Double tapping on the up and down arrows on the mobile will zoom in on the page. When flicking through the gallery try not to double tap the arrows.

Since this is an example project I would encourage you to clone and rename it so that you can use it for your own purposes.
